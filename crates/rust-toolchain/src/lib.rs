//! # rust-toolchain
//!
//! The `rust-toolchain` crate defines a set of types which describe a Rust toolchain.
//! While there is no definitive spec which defines what a "Rust toolchain" is,
//! we try to follow the official Rust release process as closely as possible.
//! The [`rustup`] project has written down a rough specification for [`toolchains`] used
//! by the Rust project. In the initial version, we will follow this spec, but disregard custom
//! toolchains altogether, in the name of simplicity.
//!
//! This project is part of the [`rust-releases`] and [`cargo-msrv`] projects.
//! In case you have a feature request, question, bug, or have another reason to contact the developers,
//! please, create a new issue at the `rust-releases` [`repository`].
